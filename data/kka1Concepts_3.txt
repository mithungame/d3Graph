ksqlDB is
the event streaming database

In Kafka, you store a collection of events in a topic
Each event can contain any raw bytes 

In ksqlDB, you store events in a stream
stream is a topic with a strongly defined schema

CREATE STREAM readings (
    sensor VARCHAR KEY,
    location VARCHAR,
    reading INT
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'readings',
    partitions = 3,
    value_format = 'json'
);

if topic does not exist create topic
save metadata in a local metadata store
data is partitioned on sensor

INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 45);

In Kafka, you model an event as a record and put it into a topic
In ksqlDB, you model an event as a row and put it into a stream. 
A row is just a record with additional metadata.

a request with the payload is sent to a ksqlDB server
check schema
reject malformed records
use Kafka producer client to insert that record into the backing Kafka topic
persisted on directly on the broker
None of it lives in ksqlDB servers

kafka way - use consumer to transform producer data
this is low level

ksqldb way - issue a persistent query to transform one stream into another using its SQL


-- process from the beginning of each stream
set 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
CREATE STREAM clean AS
SELECT sensor,
reading,
UCASE(location) AS location
FROM readings

Persistent queries are little stream processing programs that run indefinitely
ksqlDB server compiles query  to a physical execution plan as a Kafka Streams topology
The topology runs as a daemon, reacting to new topic records as soon as they become available
If you run ksqlDB as a cluster, the topology scales horizontally 
all of the processing work happens on ksqlDB server; 
no processing work happens on the Kafka brokers

When a persistent query is created, it is assigned a generated name
As each row passes through the persistent query, the transformation logic is applied to create a new row
Persistent queries completely manage their own processing progression, even in the presence of faults. ksqlDB durably maintains the highest offset of each input partition.

EVENT
An event records the fact that something happened

PRODUCERS
Producers are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka

CONSUMERS
consumers are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events. 

In Kafka, producers and consumers are fully decoupled and agnostic of each other

Events are organized and durably stored in topics

TOPICS
Topics in Kafka are always multi-producer and multi-subscriber
a topic can 0,1,N producers that write events to it, as well as 0,1,N consumers that subscribe to these events

PARTITION
Topics are partitioned
Kafka guarantees that any consumer of a given topic-partition will always read that partitions events in exactly the same order as they were written

REPLICATION
Topics are replicated
