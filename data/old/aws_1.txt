order of items 
inside vpc - AZ , Subnet , Instance(EC2)
VPC-HOME
AZ-FLOOR
SUBNET-ROOM
FRIDGE-EC2
SECURITY AT EACH FLOOR IS ROUTE TABLE
SECURITY AT VPC IS INTERNET GATEWAY
SECURITY AT FRIDGE IS SECURITY GROUP

Virtual Private Cloud
Can a VPC span multiple Region
no

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:az#id@1696053129492#parent@#x@210#y@90
can an availability zone have multiple subnets
Yes

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:subnet#id@1696053129493#parent@#x@210#y@90
subnet use 
provide Internal IP for EC2,RDS.. with in the vpc


can ec2 get a public IP address
yes
same for RDS 

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:internetGateway#id@1696053129494#parent@#x@210#y@90
Internet Gateway
control all access to outside world
If i block internet only way to reach VPC is via VPC connection

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:vpc#id@1696053129495#parent@#x@210#y@90
Security Group
I work on a per instance level , eg for EC2 , RDS
if you attach me to VPC , RDS EC2 inherit those
basically i act as a fire wall within network
you still need to open the firewall port on the actual machine itself, SG just is a control mechanism

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:nacl#id@1696053129496#parent@#x@210#y@90
NACL
Network control access list
works at subnet level
but no one uses   , they just use security group as it is more granular

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:routeTable#id@1696053129497#parent@#x@210#y@90
Route table
control Outgoing access
can block outgoing traffic at subnet  level
which in turn means VPC level
wont let you reach internet gateway

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:types#id@1696053129498#parent@#x@210#y@90
public Subnet
Router allows out going traffic

Private Subnet
Router blocked from reaching out to gateway
not allowed any public IP address
 

#?#box#calculatedX@338#calculatedY@263#children@#name@0:NAT#id@1696053129499#parent@#x@210#y@90
NAT gateway
I can forward your traffic but you still dont get public IP
Why do i need this ? say you are a database and you are in private
        and you want to access internet for a patch
but still outside world cannot access the database
Hey Route table , I am a database , though i dont need public to reach me , i need to reach internet for patching
I will point you to NAT - Network address translator
