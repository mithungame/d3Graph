octopus
what is control plane 
bunch of server services
where does it run
one or more machines
components
kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and etcd
kube-apiserver is the.
front end
kube-controller-manager is a
daemon process 
kube-controller-manager manages
Kubernetes control loop
Logically, each controller is a ---
separate process
notice and respond when nodes go down.
Node controller
create pod for one-off job
Job controller
assign node for new pod
kube-scheduler 
key-value store name
Etcd
use of Etcd
stores and replicates entire cluster state.
in what language is Etcd written 
Go and Raft protocol
why Go and Raft protocol
maintains identical logs of state changing commands across nodes and coordinates the order in which these state changes occur.
kubelet is reposible for 
communication between the Kubernetes control plane and the Node
kubelet manages the 
Pods and the containers running on a machine.

node is a 
logical VM
what is inside a node
multiple pods
mandatory node components - 
kubelet kube-proxy container runtime
icecube vasool raja whale
kube proxy implements
Kubernetes Service concept.
Container runtime
docker or other container technology
kubelet
monitor containers in pod

id@66
smallest kubernetes unit
pod
pod usually has 
one container running
sometimes two container
exampel side car pattern
what is side car pattern 
second pod captures logs 

id@1679466667599
pod is an abstraction over 
container 
why it is abstracted 
if not docker some other container
pod dont have 
permanent ip address
___ provides permanent ip address
SERVICES
pods communicate with each other using 
services

id@1679467038402
The idea of a Service is to 
group a set of Pods
example of service 
load balancer 

id@1681808765388
pods communicate internally via
cluster ip 
cluster ip is ___ ip
permanent
view ip address of clusterIP
kubectl get service

id@1681809835565
The NodePort Service is an extension of
ClusterIP Service type
nodePort value in the - range
30000--32767 range
should you assign ip 
let kubernetes do it 
why 
to avoid collision

id@1681809880031
see output as yaml 
kubectl get service -o yaml

id@1681809972394
how external client calls node port 
ip ->nodePort ->pod 8080
203.0.113.2-> 32675 -> 8080
how internal clients have two ways to call the Service
clusterIP:port.
nodeIP:nodePort

id@1681808629487
external name
Internal clients use DNS name of Service
internal dns name is 
alias for an external DNS name

id@1681810681994
ExternalName is classified as a 
service 
but its not exactly a 
service
ExternalName is not associated with 
a set of Pods
ExternalName does not have 
a stable IP address
ExternalName is a mapping from
internal to external DNS name.

id@1681808647862
You can use a headless service when 
need Pod grouping don't need stable IP address.

id@misc
if pod1 gets created first and pod2 gets created second which gets destroyed first 
no ordering guarantee
what is aws eks 
Amazon EKS is a 
managed orchestration service
Amazon EKS is integrated with many AWS services like IAM , Cloud Trail , VPC yess or no
yes
Amazon EKS provisions and scales the Kubernetes
yes
it detects replaces patches
unhealthy control plane nodes
What is the advantage of eks over ecs
eks based on kubernetes open source
what is fully managed , semi managed and self managed 
Nodes are takend care by Fargate , Nodegroup , EC2 ( full control )
Nodegroup 
create and manage EC2 instance with additional control
can we use a combination of management strategy 
yes eg EC2 and Farget 
what is ecr 
elastic container registry
ecr is like docker hub
integrates with aws services
