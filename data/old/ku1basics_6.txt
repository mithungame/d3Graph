octopus
what is control plane 
bunch of server services running on one or more machines
components
kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and etcd

kube-apiserver is the --- for the Kubernetes API server.
front end

kube-controller-manager is a ?
daemon that manages the Kubernetes control loop
Logically, each controller is a ---, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process.
separate process
eg of few:
--- : Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
Node controller
--- : Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
Job controller

kube-scheduler is a function that looks for --- that have no Nodes, and assigns them a Node based on a host of requirements
newly created Pods

---- is a highly available key-value store that provides the backend database for Kubernetes
Etcd
what is the use of Etcd
stores and replicates the entirety of the Kubernetes cluster state.
in what language is Etcd written 
Its written in Go and uses the Raft protocol
why Go and Raft protocol
it maintains identical logs of state changing commands across nodes and coordinates the order in which these state changes occur.

node is a 
logical VM on which multiple pods run VK CARNATIC
mandatory node components - 
kube-proxy (Vasool raja mbbs crazy mohan proxy exam)- implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.
Container runtime (whale)- interface with container technology such as docker 
kubelet (icecube) - It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

VK
smallest kubernetes unit
pod
pod usually has one container running inside it but it can contain more SHIP CONTAINER ON VK SHOULDER
eg two container in a pod is known as 
side car pattern - second pod captures logs

pod is an abstraction over 
container 
why it is abstracted because if not docker we can use some other container
pod keeps crashing EXPLOSIONS IN GLASSBOX so it cant have 
permanent ip address
___ provides permanent ip address
SERVICES
pods communicate with each other using services

#?#box#calculatedX@533#calculatedY@146#children@#name@2:services#id@1679467038402#parent@#x@426#y@116
services provide
permanent ip address
helps 
group pods using example a load balancer
services can span 
nodes 
types of service 
external - world facing , internal for local communication
external services has ip address not dns
ingress has a url with a name and forwards requests to service
