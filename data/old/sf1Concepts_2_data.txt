name@1:warehouse
warehouse, is a cluster of compute resources 
size x small  to 6x 

Gotcha:
1. Increasing the size of a warehouse does not always improve "data loading" performance. 

name@1:standard
content

name@2:snowparkOptimized
Snowpark workloads can be run on both Standard and Snowpark-optimized warehouses. Snowpark-optimized warehouses are recommended for workloads that have large memory requirements such as ML training use cases

name@3:SuspendAndResume
Auto-suspend and auto-resume apply to "entire" warehouse and not to the individual clusters in the warehouse.

For a multi-cluster warehouse:

Auto-suspend only occurs when the minimum number of clusters is running and there is no activity for the specified period of time. The minimum is typically 1 (cluster), but could be more than 1.

Auto-resume only applies when the entire warehouse is suspended (i.e. no clusters are running).

name@2:Tables
1. Internal - Temporary , Transient, Permanent
2. External 
3. Iceberg

Temporary
============
Longevity: Remainder of session
Cloning: Temporary => Temporary Temporary => Transient
Time Travel: 0 or 1 (default is 1)
Fail safe:0

Transient
====================
Until explicitly dropped
Transient => Temporary Transient => Transient
0 or 1 (default is 1)
0

Permanent (Standard Edition)
==============================
Until explicitly dropped
Permanent => Temporary Permanent => Transient Permanent => Permanent
0 or 1 (default is 1)
7

Permanent (Enterprise Edition and higher)
=============================
Until explicitly dropped
Permanent => Temporary Permanent => Transient Permanent => Permanent
0 to 90 (default is configurable)
7

name@1:microPartitions
contiguous units of storage
50 MB and 500 MB of "uncompressed data"
"Groups of rows" in tables are mapped into individual micro-partitions, organized in a "columnar fashion" 

name@2:Clustering
manual clustering Disabled
create table cluster by <key>
Data within micro partition is ordered by key
Table will not be 100% clustered

clustering depth ( 2 below) - number of microparitition with overlapping data
micro parition 1 - A TO F ---
                             \
micro parition 2 - A TO G --- overlap
micro parition 3 - G TO Z


<!OOO!>
To view/monitor the clustering metadata for a table, Snowflake provides the following system functions:
SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH
SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION (including clustering depth)
