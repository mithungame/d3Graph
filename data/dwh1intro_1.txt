reads from ods
cleansing layer 
can be in 3NF,called as EDW in Inmon
3NF is also called ER model 
Kimball rejects all this calls it staging 
if staging is in 3NF , its called Normalized staging
offlimits to query

Independent datamart architecture
Not a Kimball model 
example each BI department gets a data mart of its own
source -> Stage -> datamart 1 -> BI application 1 
       -> Stage -> datamart 2 -> BI application 2  
problem is if departmentA needs customer data they form their own dimension , same for departmentB
Strongly discouraged by Kimball 
but it help rapid development since each team is on its own 
sometimes each team has its own staging layer as seen in diagram
Maintenance nightmare

Dimensions must be atomic 
Dimensions must be wide and descriptive 
Dimensions must be conformed 
atomic allows adhoc query 
conformed allows single source 
Facts must be narrow and long 
uses BUS architecture TBD
contains start schema , CUBES

Users query EDW
since data is already atomic in edw , presentation area is often departmental and summarized
Not suitable for large companies as EDW layer is a perfect world

staging is 3NF but off limits to users 
Presentation area has all Kimball qualities eg: atomic dimensions
