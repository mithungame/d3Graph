warehouse, is a cluster of compute resources 
size x small  to 6x 

Gotcha:
1. Increasing the size of a warehouse does not always improve "data loading" performance.

Snowpark workloads can be run on both Standard and Snowpark-optimized warehouses. Snowpark-optimized warehouses are recommended for workloads that have large memory requirements such as ML training use cases

Auto-suspend and auto-resume apply to "entire" warehouse and not to the individual clusters in the warehouse.

For a multi-cluster warehouse:

Auto-suspend only occurs when the minimum number of clusters is running and there is no activity for the specified period of time. The minimum is typically 1 (cluster), but could be more than 1.

Auto-resume only applies when the entire warehouse is suspended (i.e. no clusters are running).

To view/monitor the clustering metadata for a table, Snowflake provides the following system functions:
SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH
