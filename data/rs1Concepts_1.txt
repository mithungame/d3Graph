An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is an enterprise-class ~*relational database query and management system~*.

A cluster is composed of one or more ~*compute nodes~*. 
If a cluster is provisioned with ~*two or more~* compute nodes, an additional ~*leader node~* coordinates the ~*compute nodes~* and handles ~*external communication~*. 
Your client application interacts directly only with the ~*leader node~*. 
The compute nodes are ~*transparent~* to external applications. why???

#?#box#calculatedX@365#calculatedY@201#children@#name@leader#id@1728902079#parent@#x@292#y@160
The leader node manages communications with ~*client programs~* and ~*compute nodes~*. 
It parses and develops ~*execution plans~* for queries. 
Based on execution plan, leader node ~*compiles code~*, distributes the compiled code to the ~*compute nodes~*, and assigns a portion of the ~*data~* to ~*each compute node~*.

The leader node distributes SQL statements to the compute nodes only when a query references ~*tables~* that are stored on the compute nodes. 
All other queries run ~*exclusively~* on the ~*leader node~*. 
certain SQL functions work only on the leader node

The compute nodes run the ~*compiled code~* and send intermediate results back to the ~*leader node~* for final aggregation.
Each compute node has its own dedicated ~*CPU and memory~*, which are determined by ~*the node type~*. 
one can increase the compute capacity of a cluster by increasing the ~*number of nodes~*, upgrading the ~*node type~*, or both.
