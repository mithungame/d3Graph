Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
  logically isolated virtual network
vpc is per region 
AWS Region is a physical location
#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@AvailabilityZones#id@1719923360#parent@#x@161#y@203
An AWS Region is a physical location where we cluster data centers, known as Availability Zones.
Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@1719923521,1719923810#name@subnet#id@1719923445#parent@#x@161#y@203
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC
#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@types#id@1719923521#parent@#x@161#y@203
Public subnet – The subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway
Private subnet – The subnet does not have a direct route to an internet gateway. 
  Resources in a private subnet require a NAT device to access the public internet.
VPN-only subnet – The subnet has a route to a Site-to-Site VPN connection through a virtual private gateway. 
  The subnet does not have a route to an internet gateway.
Isolated subnet – The subnet has no routes to destinations outside its VPC. 
  Resources in an isolated subnet can only access or be accessed by other resources in the same VPC.

Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with the default network ACL for the VPC
default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic
#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@securitygroup#id@1719923879#parent@#x@161#y@203
Security groups allow inbound and outbound traffic for associated resources, such as EC2 instances.
#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@nacl#id@1719923893#parent@#x@161#y@203
Network ACLs allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. In most cases, security groups can meet your needs.

An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.

If you use the AWS Management Console(not command line) to create a role for Amazon EC2, the console automatically creates an instance profile and gives it the same name as the role
The console does not create an instance profile for a role that is not associated with Amazon EC2
