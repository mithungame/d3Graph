While it is highly unlikely that such topics can ever lead to unanimous agreement, these topics can lead to important and thought-provoking discussions. Regardless of the numerous arguments on both sides of the conversation, through the course of this essay I shall put forth my points and calculations, considering all angles of the argument. There are a number of points in support of my argument. 

My view is that irrespective of the merits and demerits that come with these topics, the merits outweigh its demerits. Firstly, Dogs are loyal animals, and hence, we get a lot of advantages by keeping them in our home. Furthermore, Dogs have always been friendly to human beings. This is because dogs protect us from all kinds of danger because of their canine instincts. 

I see that there are numerous justifications that can support my viewpoint. For instance, the Department of American society made a study that concluded with multiple points that are in support of my argument, and hence, the proposition laid out in this essay is convincingly justified.  

In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to keeping a dog in our home. Although there are some negative side effects to having a dog in our homes, the number of reasons that suggest the opposite are simply overwhelming, and hence, the argument is in favor of my reasoning. 

 


In todayâ€™s modern era, the topic of dogs has led to a significant debate and interest, for both individuals and institutions. Though there are valid points to be considered on both sides of the aisles, I suggest that we should carefully examine the pros and cons of the topic, based on all available factual information. I shall present my essay considering all facets of the problem using factual information. 

In my opinion, we should not jump to conclusions without carefully considering all aspects of the topic. Firstly, Dogs are loyal animals, and hence, we get a lot of advantages by keeping them in our home. Furthermore, Dogs have always been friendly to human beings. In addition, dogs protect us from all kinds of danger because of their canine instincts.
